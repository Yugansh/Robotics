4. **Install ventilation** system

## Step 3: Install LED System

### LED Strip Mounting
1. **Mount LED strip** in front panel opening
2. **Secure with mounting brackets**
3. **Connect LED cables** to head module
4. **Test LED functionality**

### LED Controller
1. **Mount LED controller** in back panel
2. **Connect to LED strip**
3. **Connect control cables** to head
4. **Test LED control**

### Cable Management
1. **Route LED cables** through channels
2. **Secure cables** with cable ties
3. **Label all connections**
4. **Test all connections**

## Step 4: Create Head Connection

### Mounting Points
1. **Install mounting brackets** on top panel
2. **Create connection points** for head
3. **Test connection fit**
4. **Mark connection points**

### Cable Routing
1. **Route LED cables** to head module
2. **Secure cables** with cable ties
3. **Test LED connection**
4. **Mark connection points**

## Step 5: Add Decorative Elements

### Eye Design
1. **Add eye shape details** (optional)
2. **Create surface texture**
3. **Add decorative elements**
4. **Test functionality**

### LED Protection
1. **Install acrylic cover** over LED strip
2. **Add diffuser material** for even lighting
3. **Secure all connections**
4. **Test LED output**

## Step 6: Create Eye Animations

### Basic Animations
1. **Blinking animation** (LEDs on/off)
2. **Color changing** (RGB effects)
3. **Brightness control** (dimming effects)
4. **Pattern display** (custom patterns)

### Advanced Animations
1. **Eye tracking** (LEDs follow movement)
2. **Emotion display** (happy, sad, angry)
3. **Attention seeking** (flashing patterns)
4. **Sleep mode** (dimmed lighting)

## Step 7: Testing and Quality Control

### Individual Testing
1. **Test LED strip** and controller
2. **Test mounting** and connection points
3. **Test cable routing** and connections
4. **Test ventilation** and airflow

### Integration Testing
1. **Test eye module** with head connection
2. **Test LED animations** and effects
3. **Test mounting** and stability
4. **Test cable management**

## Step 8: Final Assembly

### Protective Elements
1. **Add ventilation** for LED cooling
2. **Secure all connections** with cable ties
3. **Add access panels** for maintenance
4. **Add decorative elements** (optional)

### Documentation
1. **Document all connections** and wiring
2. **Create assembly notes** for team
3. **Test final functionality**
4. **Prepare for integration**
