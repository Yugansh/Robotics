A DIY large-scale cardboard-based robot that combines mechanical movement with LED matrix drawing capabilities. This project uses Arduino Mega for hardware control and Python for high-level programming and pattern generation.

## Features

- **Mechanical Movement**: 4x high-torque servo motors for precise movement control
- **LED Matrix Drawing**: 16x16 LED matrix for displaying large patterns and drawings
- **Large Cardboard Construction**: Eco-friendly and easily customizable design (140-150cm height)
- **Python Interface**: Easy-to-use Python API for programming the robot
- **Arduino Control**: Reliable hardware control with Arduino Mega
